# Molotok: ATtiny85-based WS2812b Controller

I wake up both way before my partner and way before sunrise most mornings and need to see in my wardrobe to pick out clothes for the day.
I carefully aim my phone's flashlight into the closet, and, given that the process of putting on clothes generally requires that I have free hands, I've dropped my phone many times, making a great deal of noise.
So, I thought, why don't I fix this; I know I have at least a meter of neopixels available; why don't I fix this with a microcontroller?  This is that.
