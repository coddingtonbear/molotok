# Molotok: ATtiny85-based WS2812b Controller

I wake up both way before my partner and way before sunrise most mornings and need to see in my wardrobe to pick out clothes for the day.
To do this, I have to carefully aim my phone's flashlight into the closet, and, given that the process of putting on clothes generally requires that I have free hands, I've dropped my phone many times making a great deal of partner-waking noise.
So, I thought, why don't I fix this? I know I have at least a meter of neopixels available; can't basically any problem be fixed with a microcontroller and a bunch of leds?  This is that.
